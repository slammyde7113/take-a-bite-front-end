### Project History:

Description:
  Take-A-Bite is a website that allows users to search through a menu database and pick what foods they would like to purchase before they go out. Users can input a set amount of money they would like to spend and Take-A-Bite queries the menu database to return the menu items within that price range. Users can create profiles of potential foods they would like to purchase in order to pre-plan their meals.
